# Canvas app

This application is used to learn about event handling in React, including understanding controlled vs uncontrolled components, state lifting, and using DOM references.

# The challenge

Here are some challenges to practice what you learned today. 

1. Allow user to choose size (thickness) of the pencil.

2. Have a button that clears the canvas. 
 
//this.context.clearRect(0, 0, this.context.canvas.width, this.context.canvas.height);

3. Add an <input type="text" /> component that has the ability to change the name of our drawing. 

A completed version of these challenges is in the challenge-complete branch of this repository. Try to do it on your own before you look! Look back at the lesson for help if you get stuck.
